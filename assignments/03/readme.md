## Tldr

1. My report with figures is in the folder called `report`

2. I checked the page count by copying the content of the report markdown file into the
following [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XLkGJvcylcGvJImGYvKRFJ1OhfqafZ8WDpigUIq9cAg/edit?usp=sharing)
which conforms to the required page count of less than or equal to 5 pages.
