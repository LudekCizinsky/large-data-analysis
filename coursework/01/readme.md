## Tldr

1. My report should be in this folder stored as `report.md`

2. I checked the page count by copying the content of the report markdown file into the
following [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jLbjxHhlQkQInSSBaeIwfVQoBRlEqWUFvijbp-e_YiA/edit?usp=sharing)
which conforms to the required page count of less than 5 pages.
